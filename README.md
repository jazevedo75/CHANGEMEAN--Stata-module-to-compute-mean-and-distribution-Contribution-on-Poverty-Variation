# CHANGEMEAN: Stata module to compute the contribution of the mean and distribution on poverty changes

## Abstract
changemean compute the contribution of changes in the mean and the distriubtion on several welfare indicators. 

The following welfare measures are currently supported: 
- h : headcount ratio [FGT(0)] (default value)
- h2 : extremem poverty headcount ratio
- pgr : poverty gap ratio [FGT(1)]
- igr : income gap ratio
- w : Watts index
- s : Sen index
- tak : Takayama index
- thon : Thon index
- fgt1 : Foster, Greer and Thorbecke - FGT(0.5)
- fgt2 : Foster, Greer and Thorbecke - FGT(1.5)
- fgt3 : Foster, Greer and Thorbecke - FGT(2)
- fgt4 : Foster, Greer and Thorbecke - FGT(2.5)
- fgt5 : Foster, Greer and Thorbecke - FGT(3)
- fgt6 : Foster, Greer and Thorbecke - FGT(3.5)
- fgt7 : Foster, Greer and Thorbecke - FGT(4)
- fgt8 : Foster, Greer and Thorbecke - FGT(4.5)
- fgt9 : Foster, Greer and Thorbecke - FGT(5)
- chu1 : Clark, Ulph and Hemming index with beta of 0.10
- chu2 : Clark, Ulph and Hemming index with beta of 0.25
